### Description : This log in Virtualization, is to know about VMware

## VMware

VMware, Inc. is an American publicly traded software company from California. It provides cloud computing and virtualization software and services. It was one of the first commercially successful companies to virtualize the x86 architecture.

## What is a hypervisor

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.

There are two main hypervisor types, referred to as “Type 1” (or “bare metal”) and “Type 2” (or “hosted”). A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host's hardware, while a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.

## VMware ESXi

VMware ESXi is an enterprise-class, type-1 hypervisor developed by VMware for deploying and serving virtual computers. As a type-1 hypervisor,

## VMware Workstation Pro

VMware Workstation Pro is a hosted hypervisor that runs on x64 versions of Windows and Linux operating systems; it enables users to set up virtual machines on a single physical machine and use them simultaneously along with the host machine.

## VMware Workstation Player

VMware Workstation Player, formerly VMware Player, is a virtualization software package for x64 computers running Microsoft Windows or Linux, supplied free of charge by VMware, Inc., a company which was formerly a division of, and whose majority shareholder remains, Dell EMC.

## VMware vSphere

VMware vSphere is VMware's cloud computing virtualization platform. It includes an updated vCenter Configuration Manager, as well as vCenter Application Discovery Manager, and the ability of vMotion to move more than one virtual machine at a time from one host server to another,

VMware vSphere is the brand name for VMware Suit of virtualization product, Previously called VMware Infrustructure,

VMware vSphere includes

1.  VMware ESXi
    
2.  VCenter Server
    
3.  vSphere Client
    
4.  vSphere Web Client
    

Other features include Vmotion, High Avalibility, Distributed Resource Schedular (DRS), Fault Tolerance.

## VMware vSphere Client

The VMware vSphere Client is a web-based application that connects to the vCenter Server so IT administrators can manage installations and handle inventory objects in a vSphere deployment.

## vCenter Server

vCenter Server is the centralized management utility for VMware, and is used to manage virtual machines, multiple ESXi hosts, and all dependent components from a single centralized location. VMware vMotion and svMotion require the use of vCenter and ESXi hosts.

## Difference between VMware vSphere and vCenter Server

vSphere Client is an ineterface (GUI) used to connect remotly to an ESXi host from Windows PC, This client can be used to access and manage Virtual Machines on ESXi host and also perform other Management and Configuration Task.

If we want to have all the ESXi host in a Single Console then we need vCenter Server.
